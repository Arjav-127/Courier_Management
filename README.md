# Courier_Management
I developed this Courier Management System using JavaFX and MySql.
Abstract: The main aim of Courier Management Mini DBMS project is to deliver the parcel. We aim to demonstrate the use of create, read, update and delete MySQL operations through this project. The project starts by adding details of courier branch and staffs working in their respective branches. The staff then adds sender and receiver details of that parcel i.e. Booking details. Then, the parcel is scheduled for delivery. Now, when the parcel is received by the receiver branch, they deliver the parcel and delivery status is shown. 
Modules:
Courier Management Mini DBMS Project contains 4 modules:
1.	Couriers: Booking details of sender and receiver.
2.	Staff: Details of staffs working in courier branch.
3.	Schedule: Details of parcel to be scheduled.
4.	Delivery: Status of parcel delivered.
